11 ft center of table to far yellow line
each yellow line is a 1ft marker (11,10,9)
my reach is 2 feet fully extended forward (standing on 11, goes to 9)
	(release is about halfway from full extension, thus 10 ft)
table is 26" long -> yellow line at 13"
table is 26" tall
release is roughly at my height, 6 feet

(11.15 note)
	output3 and output7 had bad timelogs (indexed in middle)
	these were repaired in books/fix_vids_timelog.ipynb
	and we saved the old, bad data in bad_data sub directory

summary:

	throws are 6 - 18mph or 10 - 25 feet / sec
		arcs 6-8   mph
		lobs 12-14 mph
		hard 15-18 mph
		
	(see excel file for calcs)
