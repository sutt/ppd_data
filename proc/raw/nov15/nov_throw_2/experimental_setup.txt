11.15.18

setup

	recreated from 11.12, but after a "reset". from previous notes:
	
	11 ft center of table to far yellow line
	each yellow line is a 1ft marker (11,10,9)
	my reach is 2 feet fully extended forward (standing on 11, goes to 9)
		(release is about halfway from full extension, thus 10 ft)
	table is 26" long -> yellow line at 13"
	table is 26" tall
	release is roughly at my height, 6 feet



summary:

	note high variability in timelog: .031 to .047 consistently -> "50% variation"
	
	note this is for horizontal distance
	
	note some of these "hard" throws were faster than for throw_1/output7
	but not neccesarily "harder" but just more towards a horizontal trajectory.
	
	10-30 ft/sec
		10 arcing lob
		16-20 casual lob
		30 fastest possible

	
end point definition:
	
	start: motion blur is just started
	end: motion blur has endpoint at contact with table
